# Parametric Surfaces
- I ingnore this

# Implicit Surfaces
Implict surface are good for ray - surface intersection test and inside/outside test

## Surfaces from implicit functions
- Constant value surfaces are called (depending on whom you ask):
    - constant value surfaces
    - level sets
    - isosurfaces (if you aske me)
- Nice feature: you can add them! (and outher tricks)
    - this merge shapes
    - When you use this with exponential potentials e^-x^2, it's called Blobs, Metaballs, or Soft Objects. Great for modeling animals

# Splines
- Local control of shape
- Stability
- Derivaiable
- Easy to model
- Easy to display


If we want to interpolate between bunch of points, one of good way to do so is to use polynomial interpolation.

But this metod is very poor because it wiggle a lot

Soulution is to use piecewise polynomials
